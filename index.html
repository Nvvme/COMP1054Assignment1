<h1>"I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire" By The Ink Spots</h1>
<p>This classic hit by The Ink Spots has been a favorite since its release in 1941. Its catchy melody and heartfelt lyrics resonate deeply, making it a timeless piece.</p>
<blockquote>According to Bill Kenny Jr., son of lead singer Bill Kenny Sr., "It was just a love song – nothing political." However, during WWII, audiences associated the title line with atomic bombs.</blockquote>

<h2>Verse 1:</h2>
<p>I don't want to set the world on fire<br>
   I just want to start a flame in your heart<br>
   In my heart, I have but one desire<br>
   And that one wish is you, no other will do</p>
<h2>Chorus:</h2>
<p>I don't want to set the world on fire<br>
   I just want to start a great big flame down in your heart<br>
   You see, way down inside of me<br>
   Darling, I have only one desire<br>
   And that one desire is you<br>
   And I know, nobody else ain't gonna do</p>
<h2>Bridge:</h2>
<p>I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim<br>
   I just want to be the one you love<br>
   And with your admission that you feel the same<br>
   I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me</p>
<h2>Verse 2:</h2>
<p>Though I know that you'll never be mine<br>
   Still I've got to try until I find<br>
   Some way to show you that I care<br>
   For every girl needs love everywhere</p>
